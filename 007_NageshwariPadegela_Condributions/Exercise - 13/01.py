# Write a python script that takes the following two sets as inputs and does the following operations on those sets :
# Input Sets :
'''
set1 = {"maaza", "sprite", "fanta", "maaza"}
set2 = {"pepsi", "frooti", "sprite", "maaza"}
 Operations to be done on those Sets :
 1. Remove the duplicate elements from the set1.
 2. Add an item "7_up" to the set1.
 3. Compute the union and intersetion of set1 and set2.
 4. Compute the difference of set1 from set2.
 5. Then remove the "pepsi" element from the set2.

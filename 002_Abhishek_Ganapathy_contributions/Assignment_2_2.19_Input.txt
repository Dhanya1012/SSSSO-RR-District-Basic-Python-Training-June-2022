The Ekadashi of the bright fortnight in the month of Ashadh is called ‘Devshayani (the sleep of the Deities)’ is called ‘Ashadhi Ekadashi’ and that in the dark fortnight is called ‘Kamika Ekadashi’.

In ancient times, there was a war between Deities and demons. By performing penance, Mrudumanya, son
of demon Kumbha, acquired immortality as a boon from Lord Shankar. Therefore, even Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Shiva etc could not defeat him. Fearing him, the Deities hid on the Trikut mountain, in a cave underneath an Amla (Emblica officinalis) tree. As they had no food, it resulted in their fasting on the day of Ashadhi Ekadashi. They bathed in the rain. Then all of a sudden, energy was created from their breath which killed the demon Mrudumanya who was waiting at the entrance of the cave. This energy is the Goddess of Ekadashi.

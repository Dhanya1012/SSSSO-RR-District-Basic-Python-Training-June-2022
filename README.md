## **Let's begin the Python Show** <a name="1"></a>

### **History of Python** <a name="1.1"></a>

**Python** was developed by **_Guido van Rossum_** and was released first on **February 20, 1991** (31 years ago). It is one of the most widely-used and loved programming languages. It is also a **free** and **open-source language** with very simple and clean syntax.

<br />

### **What is Python?** <a name="1.2"></a>

1. **Python** is a **general-purpose high-level** programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right **tools** or **libraries**.
2. Its standard library is large and comprehensive. This makes it easy for **developers** to learn python.
3. Additionally, python supports **objects**, **modules**, **threads**, **exception-handling**, and **automatic memory management** which will help in modeling real-world problems and building applications to solve those problems.
4. Python is widely used in the latest and most emerging fields such as **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Web Development**, **Web Scraping**, **Data Mining**, **Data Visualization**, **Data Science**, and various other trending domains.

<br />

### **Applications of Python?** <a name="1.3"></a>

**Python** has grown to become an integral part of most of the recent web-based, desktop-based, graphic design, scientific, and computational applications. **The following are just a few applications of the enormous python language**. The List goes on and goes, as we keep exploring more and more fields, where python is used extensively.

- GUI-based desktop applications

  > Tkinter, PyQT, Kivy, WxPython, and PyGUI are the most widely used and best Python graphical user interface frameworks available.

- Graphic design, image processing applications, Games.
  > OpenCV, Pillow, and SimpleITK are some libraries of image processing.
- Web frameworks and applications.

  > Django, Flask, TurboGears, web2py and some other Python web framework are used for Python Web development.

- Business applications

  > Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems like Oodo, Tryton, OpenERP.

- Operating Systems

  > Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, macOS are the operating systems.

- Database Access

  > MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB are some database servers used by Python.

- Scientific and Numeric

  > Python has many libraries for scientific and numeric such as Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-learn, etc.

- Prototyping

  > Developers can quickly write test/validation code which gives the expected results for small to medium data sets.

- Software Development
  > Scons, Buildbot, Apache Gump, Round up, Trac.

### **How does Python Programming Language support a Complex Problem Decomposition?** <a name="1.4"></a>

1. **Python** supports **multiple** programming paradigms and features a fully dynamic type system and automatic memory management, similar to Perl, Tcl, etc. Like other dynamic languages. Python is often used as a **scripting language**.
2. If you have to work with several C libraries, and the usual is order of C is

   > write code -> compile it -> test it -> re-write -> re-compile the code -> re-test.

   - So, The cycle is slow. You need to develop **software** more quickly. Possibly, perhaps you have written a program that could use an **extension language**, and you do not want to design a language, write and debug an interpreter for it, then tie it into your application.

3. **Python** allows you to split up your big program (program with many lines of code) into modules that can be **reused**, even into other Python programs as well. It comes with a **large collection** of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs, instead of writing code for each and everything from scratch.
4. There are also built-in modules that provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.

<br />

### **What is an interpreter?** <a name="1.5"></a>

1. An **interpreter** is a program that reads and executes code line-by-line. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts.
2. Common interpreters include Perl, Python, and Ruby interpreters, which execute Perl, Python, and Ruby code respectively.
3. If we write a Python code in a text file with a name like hello.py. How does that code Run? There is a program installed on your computer named "python3" or "python", and its job is to look at and run your Python code. This type of program is called an "interpreter".

<br />

### **How To Open and Run the Interpreter which was installed?** <a name="1.6"></a>

1. There are 2 easy ways to open the interpreter:

   - Open a command-line terminal or command prompt.
   - **Mac** : run the "Terminal" app in the Utilities folder.
   - **Windows**: Type "Command Prompt" in the search box, this opens the Windows command prompt terminal. In the terminal, type the command "python3" or "python" or sometimes "py". This runs the interpreter program directly.
   - press `ctrl+d` or `ctrl+z` or `type exit()` to exit the interpreter.

     - If you have **Visual Studio Code** installed, at the top of the VS Code window, click on the **Terminal** option. And then click on the **New Terminal** option.

   - > In Visual Studio Code : Terminal > New Terminal

2. When commands are read from a **tty**, the interpreter is said to be in **interactive** mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs **(‘>>> ‘)**. `>>>` this symbol is called as `chevron prompt`. It means that python interpreter is in `interactive mode`, waiting for user input.

3. For continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots **(‘...’)**. The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt. The symbol `...` in this context, should not be compared (or) correlated with `... <ellipsis>` operator of python.

4. Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, look at this if statement:

### **Famous and Most used versions of python?** <a name="1.8"></a>

There are multiple versions of python since its inception.
Out of which, versions after `Python 3.4 ` are the most widely used ones.

1. 1989, Implementation of Python as a successor of `ABC Programming Language` started.
2. 1991, Python 0.9
3. 1994, Python 1.0
4. 2000, Python 2.0 (was popular, but no longer supported since Jan 1, 2020).
5. 2008, Python 3.0 (Famous)
6. 2022, Python 3.10 (Very Very Famous and Huge Developer Community)

- The main difference between version 2 and version 3 is **the stablity of the code has increased a lot** and there were a few changes in the syntax and also increase in **speed of execution of code**. So, Now version 2 has no support or resources so everyone should have latest version in their Local system.

 <br />

### **Why should we learn Python?** <a name="1.9"></a>

1.  By the **start** of 2022 :
    **PyPi** (Python Package Index) has > **3,50,000** Python packages (almost all of them are free and open source).
    10 million+ (1 crore+) python developers are flourishing all around the world (Huge python developer community).

2.  In the mid of 2021 :
    **6,200** companies (around the world) have used (90% of their code is written only in) Python for their platforms.
    **10,000+** Python job ads on **Glassdoor**.
    **14,000+** Python openings on **Indeed**.

3.  The number might have **doubled** by now (i.e., June 2022).

4.  A Rapid growth is being observed in the world of Python.
    Because, Python is **very easy to read, write and understand**.
    Learning Python is not as difficult as it looks, but it’s definitely **worth your efforts**.

5.  In #india, python developers are being paid well... What is the reason?

        4.27 lpa ----> 9.09 lpa ----> 11.5 lpa

6.  The following are the average salaries based on different **experience** levels

    - The average salary of an **_entry-level_** Py developer - **\*₹427,293\*\***.
    - The average salary of a **_mid-level_** Py developer - **_₹909,818_**.
    - The average salary of an **_experienced_** Py developer - **_₹1,150,000_**.

7.  _The reason is simple and straight forward_. Many of the top companies use python extensively. The following list contains, but not limited to only software companies. In fact, python is being used even by Bio-scientists, Chemical Scientists, etc..

8.  Examples of companies that use Python extensively are

> Top Financial Companies

- Goldman Sachs
- JP Morgan Chase

## **About Python** <a name="2"></a>

### **python scripts and its execution** <a name="2.1"></a>

1. A computer program is a sequence of instructions in a programming language that a computer can execute or interpret.
2. The basic difference between a **scripting language** and other general purpose programming languages such as C, C++, JAVA is that scripting languages do not need an additional step of compilation and rather they are interpreted, whereas programming languages are compiled and hence need a compilation step to convert the high-level language to machine code.
3. Scripting Languages are mainly written to automate many tasks with as less code as possible.
4. Scripting languages support "script," which is small program written for a specific runtime environment. These are interpreted at runtime rather than compiled.
5. The scripts of python are written in a file and must be saved with an extension .py. Then, at the time of execution, the python interpreter can understand that it is running the python file.
6. The scripting language refers to dynamic high-level, general-purpose interpreted languages such as Python, Perl, etc.
7. for executing the python file the command is **python filename.py**
8. Example - The script present in python file

```python
   print("I like learning Python Language")
```

execution of the python file

  ### **Commenting in python** <a name="2.2"></a>
  
  1. **Comments** are text portions that clarify what the program does and how it functions. 
  2. The character used for commenting is ```#```.
  3. The Python interpreter ignores the following text from where the character ```#``` starts.
  4. Example
  ```python
      # print("I like learning Python Language")
  ```
  ```python
  #This is a comment
  #written in
  #more than just one line
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
  
  ```console
  #output
  Hello, World!
  ```
  
  ```python
  '''
  This is a comment
  written in
  more than just one line
  
  Multiline comment
  '''
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```
 
   ```console
  #output
  Hello, World!
  ```
  
 <br />

### **Print function** <a name="2.3"></a>

1. This is the basic function which is used to print the content on the screen. This function always give a **new line**
2. Syntax for the **print** function
   > print (objects, sep = ':', end = '\n')
   - objects can be more than one.
   - Here, **sep** and **end** are **optional**. **sep** is used to seperate objects and **end** is used to tell what it should do at the end of statement.
3. Examples of the print function are

   ```python
     print("My name is Ramesh", "studying in IIT")
   ```

   - From the above print statement "My name is Ramesh" is expression -1 and "studying in IIT" expression -2.
   - Prints the expressions with spaces between them

     ```python
        print("My name is Ramesh", "studying in IIT", sep=':', end=' ')
     ```

   - Prints the expressions with : between them and also new line is avoided from end.

4. After executing the two print statement examples the answers are

 ### **Header for Python script** <a name="2.4"></a>
  
  1. The **header** is very important for the program because when anybody wants to understand your program or if you want to revise this program in the future the header will be very helpful to tell how **code works**.
  
```python
#(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-    % PYTHON %    (**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-
#
#
#
# Python Training - Chapter - 3 - Exercise 4 - Question -1 
#
# Description:
#  The code takes two integers and do arithmetic operations on the integers.
# 
#
# Usage:
#  python addition.py 
#
#
#(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-    % PYTHON %    (**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-(**/*+-

#user input

number1 = int(input("Give first number "))
number2 = int(input("Give second number "))

#arithmetic operations

add = number1 + number2
sub = number1 - number2
multiply = number1 \* number2
div = number1 / number2
expo = number1 \*\* number2

print("The results are")
print("addition ", add)
print("substraction ", sub)
print("multiply ", multiply)
print("division ", div)
print("exponentation ", expo)

````

* running script
> PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python operations.py

```console
# output

Give first number 12
Give second number 2

The results are
addition  14
substraction  10
multiply  24
division  6.0
exponentation  144
````

<br />
   
### **Indentation** <a name="2.5"></a>

1. **Indentation** plays a very important role in writing **python script**.
2. The meaning of indentation is the proper **arranging** of the lines of code in the script.
3. For arranging we can either use **Tab** or **Space**. But the right way is to use Tab which makes our code to write easily.
4. Now let's understand with an example

```python
# Convert the command line parameters (arguments) to numbers
num1 = 7
num2 = 10

# Determine which number is largest and perform the subtraction
if num1 > num2:
  diff = num1 - num2
  print(num1, "-", num2, "=", diff)
else:
  diff = num2 - num1
  print(num2, "-", num1, "=", diff)
```

- running script
  > PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python indentation.py

```console
# output

10 - 7 = 3
```

From the above example, we can see there is a white space after the `if` line it is given because the lines should be executed only when the `If` condition satisfies. Similarly for the 'else' condition.

<br />
  
 ### **Continuation lines** <a name="2.6"></a>
 
  1. If we are writing one big statement that occupies more than one line then we will be using this character ```\```. 
  2. This character ```\``` should be the end of the line.
  3. For example 
   ```python
     print("My company \
     name is \
     Multiple Wishes.")
   ```
   when we run the script the output is
   <img src="https://github.com/Vissamsetty-Bharathrath/python3_ebook/blob/master/Training/11.jpg" alt="Continuation lines" width="600"/>

## **Data Types** <a name="3"></a>

1. **Variables** can hold values, and every value has a data-type.
2. **Data-types** in Python can be either mutable or immutable.
3. A **mutable** object can be changed after it is created, and an **immutable** object cannot. Objects of built-in types like (int, float, bool, str, tuple, frozenset) are immutable. Objects of built-in types like (list, set, dict) are mutable. Custom classes are generally mutable.

| Class     | Description                      | Immutable |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | --------- |
| bool      | Boolean value                    | Yes       |
| int       | Integer                          | Yes       |
| float     | Float point number               | Yes       |
| list      | Mutable sequence of objects      | No        |
| tuple     | Immutable sequence of objects    | Yes       |
| str       | Character string                 | Yes       |
| dict      | Associative mapping (dictionary) | No        |
| set       | Unique set of values             | No        |
| frozenset | Immutable form of set            | Yes       |

<br />
  
### **Integer data type** <a name="3.1"></a>

1. The **integer** data type has only numbers without decimals in it. The numbers are either positive or negative.
2. Examples:

```python
    No_of_wickets = 5
    overs_bowled = 4
```

<br />

### **Floating-point data type** <a name="3.2"></a>

1. The **floating** point data is the having decimal point after integers.
2. 2. Examples:

```python
strike_rate_of_batsman = 105.45
economy_of_bowler = 6.25
```

3. we can also represent the floating point with **e** or **E**. **e** **E** means is the power of 10.

```python
strike_rate_of_batsman = 80e5
economy_of_bowler = 24E3
overs_bowled = 4.3
```

- After we print the above variables the answers are
  <img src="https://github.com/Vissamsetty-Bharathrath/python3_ebook/blob/master/Training/21.jpg" alt="Floating_data_type" width="500"/>

<br />

### **Complex data type** <a name="3.3"></a>

1. The **complex** data type is has an imaginary part in it. The imaginary part is represent with **j**.
2. Examples

```python
a = 3+7j
b = 5-9j
```

 <br />
 
### **Boolean data type** <a name="3.4"></a>

1. It has two values **True** and **False**
2. Examples

```python
ram_age = 25
shyam_age = 12
print(ram_age > shyam_age)
print(ram_age < shyam_age)
```

```console
Output :
True
False
```

<br />

### **Frozen sets** <a name="3.5"></a>

1. The method `frozenset`  in Python takes an iterable object as input and renders it immutable. Simply put, it renders iterable things unchangeable by freezing them.
2. In Python, a `frozenset` is the same as a set, except that frozensets are immutable, which implies that once generated, elements from the frozenset cannot be added or deleted.
3. This method accepts any iterable object as input and turns it to an immutable object. The element order is not guaranteed to be kept.

```python
person = {"name": "Ram", "age": 21, "sex": "male"}

f_Set = frozenset(person)
print('The frozen set', f_Set)
```

```console
# output
The frozen set is: frozenset({'name', 'sex', 'age'})

```

use of  dictionary as an iterable for frozen set, the set is created using just the dictionary's keys.

```python
# converting a list into a frozenset using the frozenset() function.

list = ['sai', 'ram', 'shyam']
y = frozenset(list)
print(y)
```

```console
# output

frozenset({'sai', 'ram', 'shyam'})
```

<br />

### **Conversion of one data type to another** <a name="3.6"></a>

1. We can **convert** from int to float, int to complex, float to int, float to complex.
2. We can not convert the complex to int or float data types.
3. Examples

```python
a = 34
b = 36.5
c = 2 +5j

m = float(a) #convert from int to float
n = complex(a) #convert from int to complex
o = int(b) #convert from float to int:
p = complex(b) #convert from float to complex

output
34.0
(34+0j)
36
(36.5+0j)
```

<br />

## **Variables** <a name="4"></a>

### **Python Variable** <a name="4.1"></a>

1. **Variable** is a name that is used to refer to a **memory location**.
2. Variables are also known as **identifiers** and they are used to hold specific values. Variable names can be a group of both the **letters** and **digits**, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.
   > we need not mention the datatypes of the variables because python automatically detects the types of the variables, based on the values that you assign to those variables.
3. Variables names are **case sensitive**. For example, there are two variables **amount** and another variable is **Amount**. Both the variables are different, and both of them will be accessed and used seperately.

```python
x = 10
_x = 20
```

Here the variable `x` and `_x` refers to an integer object. Leading Underscore before variable/function/method name indicates to programmer that It is for internal use only, that can be modified whenever class want.

The following are some examples of a few variables

```console
name = 'Ram'
Weight = 60
height = 80.50
```

We can get the data type of any object by using the `type()` function:
For Example :

```python
## Print the data type of the variable x:

>>> x = 5
>>> print(type(x))
<class 'int'>
```

Here the output provided by the interpreter is : `<class 'int'>` because an integer value is assigned to the variable `x`.

<br />
  
### **Common conventions followed for variable names** <a name="4.2"></a>
  
The following are the two most common types of variable naming conventions followed across the globe
  1. **Snake Case** : This looks like instead of space we use **underscore(_)**. For example is **name_of_the_student**
  2. **Camel Case** : This looks like for each new word it starts with **capital letter**. For example is **NameOfTheStudent**
  
<br />

> **PEP8** is Python's official style guide and it recommends : Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. i.e., **Snake Case**

### **Creating good names** <a name="4.3"></a>

1. Variable names should be _meaningful_, _self explanatory_, and also they should **represent the purpose for which they are created**.
2. Meaningful variable names can make our **code more readable**, **easier to debug code** and also **maintain it**.
3. Some scenarios to explain why a proper naming convention is essential for **readability** of the code.
   - `n` - We cannot get any information from this variable name `n`.
   - `name` - able to understand but what name
   - `name_of_the_student` - very easy to understand and very appropriate for its purpose of usage.

<br />

### **Exercise - 2** <a name="4.4"></a>

1. Create a variable having the name: `student_name` and assign the value `Ramesh` to that newly created variable.
2. Given the problem to substract 5 from 10, using two variables with names: `number1` and `number2` and store the final result in `number3`.Print the final output.
3. Write a script that defines and uses the following variables for writing a meaningful english line

```console
colour = "blue"
fruit = "Mango"
number = 22
article = "is"
```

- use the variables above to print the following statements exactly

```console
sky is blue, Mango is yellow, age of suresh is 22 .
```

## **User input** <a name="5"></a>

1. They are **two** possibilities in which the user can give inputs to the python programs. They are :
1. Using `input()` function
1. Using **command line parameters (arguments)**.

### **input function** <a name="5.1"></a>

3. The `input()` function always takes the input given by user as a string by default. whatever input the user gives will automatically be converted to a string by the `input()` function.
4. The user should perform **type casting** to get back the actual type of the input that he provided to the program.

Examples for **input function**

```python
name_of_user = input("Name of the user: ")
print(type(name_of_user))
print(name_of_user)
print()

age_of_user = input("Age of the user: ")
print(type(age_of_user))
print(age_of_user)
print()

converted_age_of_user_to_integer = int(input("Age of the user: "))
print(type(converted_age_of_user_to_integer))
print(converted_age_of_user_to_integer)
```

```console
output

Name of the user: Ram
<class 'str'>
Ram

Age of the user: 15
<class 'str'>
15

Age of the user: 15
<class 'int'>
15
```

  <br />
  
 
### **Command line parameters (arguments)** <a name="5.2"></a>

1.  Command line parameters are also known as _Command line arguments_.
2.  The values or parameters that we would like to give as inputs within the program, are provided directly with the python script execution command, before we even run the program.
3.  A list of strings named `argv` is provided inside the code for values.
4.  Each value given in the command is consider as string and also have infinite number of values that are separated with spaces.
5.  To use `argv` we should import the module into the script

```python
 from sys import argv
```

6.  The variable `argv[n]` may be used to access each command line parameter in our program.

    - Here n is index of the value.
    - `argv[0]` is script name and `argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, etc are contains values.
    - Example
      PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python test.py Ram 15 70.45

      1. test.py is `argv[0]`
      2. They are three command line parameters (arguments)

         - Ram is `argv[1]`
         - 15 is `argv[2]`
         - 70.45 is `argv[3]`

Examples for **command line parameters (arguments)**
Python script

```python
  from sys import argv
  num1 = argv[1]
  num2 = argv[2]
  num3 = int(argv[3])
  num4 = int(argv[4])
  addition1 = num1 + num2
  addition2 = num3 + num4
  print("The total addition1 result is", addition1)
  print("The total addition2 result is", addition2)
```

running script

> PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python command_line_parameter.py 10 20 30 40

```console
# Output

The total addition1 is 1020
The total addition2 is 70
```

1. From the above script, the following are the few aspects to be remembered :
   - By default `argv`, consider any input argument that we provide as a string. So, we should explicitly type cast the value that are passed to the program via `argv`. We need to be clear of the data type that we will be type casting to within the program. So, the values that we send the program as input have to be apt their to actual datatypes (they should be easily type casted back to their respective types).

 <br />
    
 ### **Exercise - 3** <a name="5.3"></a>
 
 1. Write the script asking the user to give two integers and multiply them.
 2. Take the command line parameter any name you want (C:> C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python command_line_parameter.py Girish and print in the following paragraph.
```python    
Girish is very good boy who helps everyone and also Girish participates in all the sports and cultural meet. Girish hobbies are playing virtual games and also watching movies.
```
 3. Write the script for calculating area of trainagle ( ask user to enter base and height).
 4. Write the script of the student form(name_of_student, class_studying, college_name, city_lives) that accepts as command line parameters and prints as
 ```python
  student_name : Hareesh sai
  class        : 12th
  college_name : SSB
  city_lives   : Hyderabad
 ```
* Here ```student_name``` value has spaces so keep in quotations to print the whole value.

1. Strings can be enclosed in **single quotes** or **double quotes**.

> Example :- "Multiple_wishes" 'Multiple_wishes'

2. In the case of string handling, the operator `+` is used to concatenate two strings as the operation ```"Multiple"```+```" Wishes"``` returns ```"Multiple Wishes"```.

<br />

### **Indexing** <a name="7.1"></a>

1. To retrieve an element of the list, we use the **index** operator `[ ]` :

&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Indexing

### **Object Identity** <a name="7.2"></a>

1. In Python, every created **object** identifies **uniquely** in Python.
2. Python provides the guaranteed that **no two objects will have the same identifier**. The built-in ```id()``` function, is used to identify the object identifier.
> The following program illustrates the assignment and reassignment of values to objects.

```python
a = 50
b = a
print("Id of a variable is",id(a))
print("Id of b variable is",id(b))
# Reassigned variable a
a = 500
print("Id of a variable is",id(a))
```

```console
Output:
Id of a variable is 140734982691168
Id of b variable is 140734982691168
Id of a variable is 2822056960944
```

<br />

### **Program using builtin function**: <a name="7.3"></a>

1. The following examples demonstrate the usage and importance of  *accessing*, *updating*, *formating*, *slicing*, *concatenating* and *escaping* in strings

> Example - 1

```python
str1 = "Multiple_Wishes"
str2 = "Py_wishes"
print("Id number for str1 is ", id(str1), "\n" "Id number for str2 is ", id(str2))
# str1[1] = 'a' # illegal, since strings are (immmutable)
# new string created from old ones
str1 = str1[:1] + 'i' + str1[6:]
print("by indexing and adding i str1 is :", str1, str2)
print("Now str1,str2 id's are: ", id(str1), id(str2))
Name = "Multiple_Wishes"
print("Finding the letter index ", Name.index('e'))
print(Name.index('is'))
print('a' in Name)
print(Name.upper(), Name.lower())
print(Name.replace('p', 'b'))
Symbol = ";"
print(Symbol.join(('Multiple_Wishes', 'Hyd', 'India')))
Name = "Multiple_Wishes"
print("Printing name 3times: ", Name*3, "\n" "Length of name is: ",len(Name))
print(Name[0:10])
Str_name = "hello123"
print("Is Str_name contains numbers: ", Str_name.isalnum(), "\n" "Is string name contains Alphabets: ", Str_name.isalpha())
val = "123"
print(val.isdigit())
Name = "Multiple_Wishes"
print(Name.isalpha())
```
```console
#Output:

```
The function ```eval()``` evaluates the passed string as a Python expression and returns the result. For example, ```eval("1 + 2")``` interprets and executes the expression ```"1 + 2"``` and returns the result (3).

> Example - 2

```python
# Using Backslash to continue statements
a = 2 + \
1.5 * 3
print("a = ", a)
b = eval("5.2") + 3
print("b = ", b)
print(eval("4 < 10"))
print(eval("'Multiple_wishes '  * 5"))
print(eval("abs(-11)"))
print(eval('"Multiple_Wishes".upper()'))
# print(eval('os.getcwd()'))
c = eval("2.3") + 2
print("c = ", c, type(c))
d = "3.2" + "3"
print("d = ", d, type(d))
# use the implicit continuation inside parenthesis
e = ([5, 12, 13, 200])
print("e1 = ", e)
```

```console

#Output:
a =  6.5
b =  8.2
True
Multiple_wishes Multiple_wishes Multiple_wishes Multiple_wishes Multiple_wishes
11
MULTIPLE_WISHES
c =  4.3 <class 'float'>
d =  3.23 <class 'str'>
e1 =  [5, 12, 13, 200]

### **Formatting with `.format method`** <a name="7.4"></a>

1. Example:

```python
string_name = "multiple_wishes"
print(f"Name of the string is : {string_name}")
#or
print("Name of the string is : {}".format(string_name))
```

```console
#Output :
Name of the string is : multiple_wishes
Name of the string is : multiple_wishes
```

Here by using ```.format``` the ```string_name``` is inserted in `{}`.

<br />
  
## **Important points to remember** <a name="7.5"></a>

1. Python includes methods for converting any value to a string, such as `repr()` and `str()`.
2. The `str()` method is intended to yield **human-readable** representations of values, whereas `repr()` is intended to provide **interpreter-readable** representations . When providing output for end users, almost always use str.
3. The `repr()` function is mostly for **troubleshooting and exploration**. For example, if you think a string has non-printing characters or a float contains a little rounding mistake, `repr()` will disclose it but `str()` may not.

```python
s="genesis"
"""
   The string 'genesis' has the name s connected to it. When you call str(s),
   the interpreter replaces s with 'genesis' and then calls str('genesis').
"""
print(str(s))
print(repr(s))
```

```console
# output

genesis
'genesis'
```

### **Python has builtin functions, methods & keywords for string. They are used for program:** <a name="7.6"></a>

- [Python Built in Functions](https://github.com/saikrishnavadali05/python3_ebook/blob/36c9f6d569020420975b78432e6f093a21c3829c/Methods&keywords/PYTHON_BUILTIN_FUNCTION.MD)

## **Slicing Operator** in Lists and Strings <a name="7.7"></a>

The syntax is:
```python
a[start:stop]  # items start through stop-1
a[start:]      # items start through the rest of the array
a[:stop]       # items from the beginning through stop-1
a[:]           # a copy of the whole array
```
There is also the step value, which can be used with any of the above:
```python
a[start:stop:step] # start through not past stop, by step
```
The key point to remember is that the ```:stop``` value represents the first value that is not in the selected slice. So, the difference between stop and start is the number of elements selected (if step is 1, the default).

The other feature is that start or stop may be a negative number, which means it counts from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:

```python
a[-1]    # last item in the array
a[-2:]   # last two items in the array
a[:-2]   # everything except the last two items
```
Similarly, step may be a negative number:
```python
a[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed
a[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed
a[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed
a[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed
```
Python is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than you ask for. For example, if you ask for ```a[:-2]``` and a only contains one element, you get an empty list instead of an error. Sometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware that this may happen.

Relationship with the slice object
A slice object can represent a slicing operation, i.e.:

```a[start:stop:step]```
is equivalent to:
```a[slice(start, stop, step)]```
Slice objects also behave slightly differently depending on the number of arguments, similarly to ```range()```, i.e. both slice(stop) and slice(start, stop[, step]) are supported. To skip specifying a given argument, one might use None, so that e.g. a[start:] is equivalent to a[slice(start, None)] or a[::-1] is equivalent to a[slice(None, None, -1)].

While the `:`-based notation is very helpful for simple slicing, the explicit use of slice() objects simplifies the programmatic generation of slicing.

## **Conditional statements** <a name="9"></a>

### ```if``` statement: <a name="9.1"></a>

1. ```if``` statement is the most simple ***decision-making*** statement.
2. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not based on certain conditions that we provide after the ```if``` keyword i.e, if a certain condition is satisified or ```True```, then the block of statements under if will be executed. if that condition is not satisfied or ```False```, the statements that are under the ```if``` block are not executed. 
3.  For an ```if``` statememt, the ```elif``` and ```else``` blocks are **optional**. 
4.  while writing ```if``` statements, we should make sure that, we are writing the code with **proper indentation**, otherwise the code execution stops, displaying indentation related errors. 

5. Some of the condition checks than can be done within an `if` statement:

- Equals: `a == b`
- Not Equals: `a != b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`

> Example for a simple `if` statement:

```python
weight = int(input("give your weight "))
if(weight > 70):
  print("You have to reduce your weight.")
```

```console
 Script Execution in Command Prompt
  PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python conditions.py

 Output :
 give your weight 80
 You have to reduce your weight.
```

> Example for an `if` - `else` statement:

```python
number = int(input("Enter the number "))
if number > 40:
    print("you are old")
else:
    print("you are young")
```

```console
Script Execution in Command Prompt
PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python conditions_1.py

output
Enter the number 12
you are young
```

> Example for an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement:

```python
Mutiple_wishes = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
if Mutiple_wishes < 0:
    print('Less than zero')
elif Mutiple_wishes == 0:
    print('Zero')
else:
    print('greater than zero')
```

```console
Output:
Please enter an integer: 1
greater than zero
```

 <br /> 
  
### **Exercise - 7**  <a name="9.2"></a>
  
  1. Write a script to check whether the given year is a *leap year* or not. The input i.e., year, should be given during script execution itself. i.e, as a command line parameter.
  2. Write a script to check whether the given number is *odd or even* by requesting input from the user, using ```input()``` function.
  3. Write a script that requests the user to give an input and given Kilometers convert to Miles. if there are more digits after decimal round to two digits.
  
  ```console
  For Example,
    If the input from the user is : 4.8
    The output that the program shall provide is 2.98 miles.

## **Loops**<a name="10"></a>

### **``While loop```** <a name="10.1"></a>

1. syntax for `while` is

```console
  While expression:
    code to write
```

    - the code in the while executes continously as long as the expression evaluates to be true.
    - When the expression evaluates as False, then the loop terminates.

2. Examples of `while` loop
```python
i = 2
while i > 0:
  print(" i is ", i)
  i = i - 1
print("loop executed")
```

```console
running script
PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python while_statement.py

output
i is  2
i is  1
loop executed
```

### **```for```** loop <a name="10.2"></a>

1. The ```for``` loop in Python is used to **iterate the statements** or a part of the program several times. 
2.  It is frequently used to traverse the data structures like list, tuple, or dictionary.

3.   Example:


```python
str = "MultipleWishes"
for i in str:
    print(i)

Output:
M
u
l
t
i
p
l
e
W
i
s
h
e
s
```

4.  Example of `for` loop using `f` formatting:

```python
s = "Multiple_wishes"
"""
Name s is attached to 'Multiple_wishes' string. When you call str(s) the
interpreter puts 'Multiple_wishes' instead of s and then calls str('Multiple_wishes').
"""
print(str(s))
print(repr(s))
for x in range(1, 7):
    print(str(x).rjust(2), str(x*x).rjust(5), sep=":", end=" ")
    # Note use of 'end' in the above
    print(str(x*x*x).rjust(4), end=" ")
    print(str(x*x*x*x).rjust(4), end=" ")
    print(str(x*x).rjust(6))

print()
for x in range(1, 5):
    print('{0:2d} {1:4d} {2:4d}'.format(x, x*x, x*x*x))
print()
print('12'.zfill(10))
print('3.14159265'.zfill(5))
print('-3.14'.zfill(6))
print('{0:2} {1:2} {2:2}'.format('company', 'and', 'Multiple_wishes'))
print()
print("PI value is approximately {0:.5f}".format(3.14159265))
print('{0} is {1}'.format('Country', 'India'))
print('{1} {2} {0}'.format('Country', 'India', 'is'))
print('Our {key} is {data}'.format(key='country', data='india'))
print('{0} {company}'.format('Multiple_wishes', company='dream'))
```

```console
Outputs

Multiple_wishes
'Multiple_wishes'
 1:    1    1    1      1
 2:    4    8   16      4

### **```for``` loop help in lists**

```python
My_Lists = ['Multiple_Wishes', 'Pywishes', 'Hyderabad']
for x in My_Lists:
    print("length of", x, "is", len(x))

name = []

for x in My_Lists:
    if len(x) > 8: name.insert(0, x)
print(name)

months = ['jan', 'feb', 'march', 'april']
for i in range(4):
    print(f"month {i+1}:", (months[i]))

months = ['july', 'august', 'september', 'october']
for num, name in enumerate(months, start=7):
    print(f"month {num}: {name}")
```

```console
Output:
length of Multiple_Wishes is 15
length of Pywishes is 8
length of Hyderabad is 9
['Hyderabad', 'Multiple_Wishes']
month 1: jan
month 2: feb
month 3: march
month 4: april
month 7: july
month 8: august
month 9: september
month 10: october
```

## **```range``` function:** <a name="11"></a>

1. If you do need to iterate over a **sequence of numbers**, use the built-in function ```range()```. 
2. It generates lists containing arithmetic progressions:

 - Python’s `range(1, 10)` function returns a list of consecutive integers, in this case the list ```[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]```.
   So, the `for` statement `for i in range(1, 10))` is equivalent to:
   
This is a range object. If you want a list with numbers 1 to 1000 with 2 as steps in it you can do like this:

```list(range(1, 1000, 2))```
If you don't want to change the values in the list, using tuple is a better option:

```tuple(range(1, 1000, 2))```
Range object is different from a list. It doesn't actually contain numbers from 1 to 1000. When you use it in a for loop it generates numbers as it loops through.

For example if you create a range from one to then thousand its not gonna take a lot of memory; but when you convert it to a list, that's when all the actual numbers are gonna be stored in the memory.

In Python 2, range would return a list, but in Python 3 range is an immutable sequence of type range. As stated in python documents:

The advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple is that a range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the start, stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).

But this doesn't mean you can't use indexing for a range object. Since they are immutable sequences, you can apply indexing on them the same way as a list. The return value will be a range object as well (unless its not sliced and it's only selecting one single element, then it would return that number as int).

```range()``` function only works with the integers i.e. whole numbers. All arguments must be integers. Users can not pass a string or float number or any other type in a start, stop and step argument of a ```range()```. All three arguments can be positive or negative.

```python
for i in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

> An example scenario containing the usage of `range()` function:

```python
for i in range(1, 5):
    print(i, " ", i * i)
print()
for i in range(0, 25, 5):
    print(i, " ", i * i)
print()
print(list(range(0, -10, -2)))
```

```console
Output:

1   1
2   4
3   9
4   16

0   0
5   25
10   100
15   225
20   400

[0, -2, -4, -6, -8]
```

It is possible to nest a lists (create lists containing other lists) within another list.

> An example code snippet to illustrate nested lists:

```python
data = ["a", 'b', 10, 3]
print(data)
print(data[1], data[1:-1])
print(data[:2], ['c', 3 * 1])
data[2:3] = [20, 30]  # change items
print(data)
data[2:4] = []  # remove items
print(data)
data[2:2] = [15, 18, 22]  # insert items
print(data)
print("length of data", len(data))
# nesting of lists
a = [10, 20, 12, 3]
b = [5, a, 30]
print(b)
print(b, b[1])
a.sort()
print(a)
b[1].append(25)
print(b)
```

```console
Output:

['a', 'b', 10, 3]
b ['b', 10]
['a', 'b'] ['c', 3]
['a', 'b', 20, 30, 3]
['a', 'b', 3]
['a', 'b', 15, 18, 22, 3]
length of data 6
[5, [10, 20, 12, 3], 30]
[5, [10, 20, 12, 3], 30] [10, 20, 12, 3]
[3, 10, 12, 20]
[5, [3, 10, 12, 20, 25], 30]
```

> An example code snippet of a list being used along with **membership** operators

### Python Functions <a name="12"></a>
1. Functions are the most important aspect of an application. 
2. A function can be defined as the organized block of **reusable code**, which can be called whenever required. 
3. The keyword ```def``` introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters.
4. The Function helps to programmer to break the program into the smaller part. It **organizes** the code very effectively and **avoids** the repetition of the code. As the program grows, function makes the program more organized.
5. There are mainly two types of functions.

- User-define functions - The user-defined functions are those define by the **user to perform the specific task**.

- Built-in functions - The built-in functions are those functions that are **pre-defined** in Python.

6.Example of Function 1:
```python
def square(a):
 return a * a

print(square.__doc__)

val = square(3)
print(val)
print(type(val))

val = square
print("val(2)",val(2))
```
```console
Output:
None
9
<class 'int'>
val(2) 4
```  
 
7. Example of Functions 2: 
 ```python
def sumodd(n = 5):
  val = 0
  index = 1
  while (index <= n):
  # if even we continue with next iteration
    if (index % 2 == 0):
      index += 1
      continue
  # if odd we add it
    val += index
    index += 1
  return val
def funNotImplemented(): pass
print("sumodd is", sumodd(3))
print("sumodd is", sumodd())
funNotImplemented()
```
```console
Output:
sumodd is 4
sumodd is 9
```  
8.Example of Functions 3 with Keyword Argument:
```python
def funckeyword(arg1, arg2='Multiple', arg3='Wishes'):
  print("arg1=", arg1, "arg2=", arg2, "arg3=", arg3)
funckeyword(10)
funckeyword(arg1="value1")
  
funckeyword(10, arg2="Multiple")
funckeyword(10, arg3="Wishes", arg2="MultipleWishes")
funckeyword(arg3="Hyderabad", arg1="value1")
```
```console
arg1= 10 arg2= Multiple arg3= Wishes
arg1= value1 arg2= Multiple arg3= Wishes
arg1= 10 arg2= Multiple arg3= Wishes
arg1= 10 arg2= MultipleWishes arg3= Wishes
arg1= value1 arg2= Multiple arg3= Hyderabad
```

 <br />
   
 ## **Exercise-10** <a name="12.1"></a>
  
 1. Write a function that take string as a parameter. the string is given by the user as input. the final output from the function is to reverse the string.
 ```python
  example the string is Multiple - output is elpitluM
 ```
 
 2.  Write a function that take three integers and compare which the largest and smallest among the them. take input from the end user.
 ```python
  example the given numbers are 45, 22, 60 - output is largest is 60 and smallest is 22
 ```
 
 <br />

## **Lists** <a name="13"></a>

1. A ```list``` in Python is used to store the **sequence of various types of data**. 
2. Python lists are **ordered** and **mutable** type its mean we can modify its element after it created. 
3. The items in the list are separated with the (comma) ```,``` and enclosed with the square brackets ```[]```. Lists can contain items of different types.

Basic examples

```python
>>> numbers = [0, 5, 8, 11, 12]
>>> months = ["january", "March", "April"]
>>> student = ["suresh", 80, 6.2] #list also contain different data types
```

<br />

### **Exercise-11** <a name="13.1"></a>

## **Tuples:** <a name="14"></a>

1. Tuples are like lists, but are **ordered** and **immutable** like strings, i.e. unchangeable (it is not possible to assign to the individual items of a tuple).
2. They are enclosed by **parentheses** or nothing at all, rather than brackets.

```python
t1 = (12, 5, 8)
print("index 1 in t1 is :", t1[1])
print(len(t1), max(t1), min(t1))
# t1[0] = 10 # illegal, due to immutability
t2 = ("hello", 5)
t3 = (t1 + t2)
print(t3)
print(5 in t1)
for val in t1:
    print(val)
print(t1[1:])
del t1
print(t3)
# print(t1) throws error as we deleted t1
print(type(t2[0]))
print(type(t3))
```
```console
Output:

index 1 in t1 is : 5
3 12 5
(12, 5, 8, 'hello', 5)
True
12
5
8
(5, 8)
(12, 5, 8, 'hello', 5)
<class 'str'>
<class 'tuple'>
```

If we want to change or add values to the tuple then we can only achieve it by changing the ```tuple``` into ```list```, then update(add/remove) items to it and convert back to tuple.

```python
phone_tuple = ("Redmi", "LG", "Apple")
phone_list = list(phone_tuple)
phone_list.append("Realme")
phone_tuple = tuple(phone_list)
print(phone_tuple)
```
```console
running script
PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python lists.py

output
('Redmi', 'LG', 'Apple', 'Realme')
```

 <br />
  
 
### **Exercise - 12** <a name="14.1"></a>
  
 1. Write a python script that does the following operations:
 ```console
 Input to the script will be a tuple with bike names : ("pulsar", "duke", "shine")

 *Script should* : 
 1. give the total number of items present in the tuple.
 2. give the index number for "shine" in the tuple.
 3. add the item "splendor" to the tuple.
 4. remove the item "duke" from the tuple.
 ```

## **Sets** <a name="15"></a>

1. A ```set``` contains uniques values in it. It is denoted with *curly braces :* `{}`. The values in the ```set``` are unordered and also it deletes the duplicate values. Once the ```set``` is created, we can not update the existing values. But new values can be added (appended). In ```set``` we cannot access values with the help of index, which is possible in tuples and lists easily.
2. A few examples of code snippets showing the usage of sets

```python
name_set = {"Harish", "Ramesh", "Suresh"}
for i in name_set:
print(i)
```

```console
running script

### **Exercise - 13**<a name="15.1"></a>

1. Write a python script that takes the following two sets as inputs and does the following operations on those sets :

```python
# Input Sets :
set1 = {"maaza", "sprite", "fanta", "maaza"}
set2 = {"pepsi", "frooti", "sprite", "maaza"}
```

```console
 Operations to be done on those Sets :
 1. Remove the duplicate elements from the set1.
 2. Add an item "7_up" to the set1.
 3. Compute the union and intersetion of set1 and set2.
 4. Compute the difference of set1 from set2.
 5. Then remove the "pepsi" element from the set2.
```

## **Dictionary:** <a name="16"></a>

1. Dictionary (hash) which is also called **associative arrays**. 
2. Dictionary is a built-in Python Data Structure that is **mutable**. 
3. Dictionaries are used to store data values in **key:value** pairs. 
4. A dictionary is a collection which is **ordered**. 
5. Deletion of an element from a dictionary can be done via ```pop()```. The ```in``` operator works on dictionary keys. 
6. As of Python **version 3.7**, dictionaries are **ordered**. In Python **3.6** and earlier, dictionaries are **unordered**.
7. Terminology Key/Value pairs definition
> An example dictionary with the variable name `student` :

```python

# Dict notation : {} (curly braces)
student = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'courses': ['Math', 'CompSci']}

# Dictionary values can be accessed with the help of using corresponing keys in (square brackets) []
print(student['name'])

# Finding out the number of keys in dict can be done with the help of len() function
print(len(student))

# Print all the keys with keys() method 
for key in student.keys():
    print(key)

# Print all the values with values() method 
for value in student.values():
    print(value)

# Print both the keys as well as the values with items() method
for key, value in student.items():
    print(key, value)
```

8. `get()` access of the dict accessing a key that does not exist with the `get()` method as opposed to `[]` square bracket access Specifying a default value for keys that do not exist Adding a new entry to dictionary Changing/updating values via key access Changing/updating values via `update`() method. `update()` takes in a dict as an argument Deleting a specific key and its value Option 1 for deleting a key and value: `del` keyword Option 2 for removing a key and value: `pop()` method Remember the `pop()` method not only removes the item put pops it off or returns it to you Therefore you can recover the popped item with a variable assignment How to loop through all the keys and values

## **OrderedDict module** <a name="16.1"></a>

An ```OrderedDict``` is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which its contents are added, supporting the usual ```dict``` methods. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged. Deleting an entry and reinserting it will move it to the end.

> Example : OrderDictionary1.py

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
od = OrderedDict()
od['c'] = 1
od['b'] = 2
od['a'] = 3
print(od.items())
d = {}
d['c'] = 1
d['b'] = 2
d['a'] = 3
print(d.items())

Output:

odict_items([('c', 1), ('b', 2), ('a', 3)])
dict_items([('c', 1), ('b', 2), ('a', 3)])
```

> Example : OrderDictionary2.py

Key value Change: Even if the value of a certain key is changed, the position of the key remains unchanged in an ```OrderedDict```.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
print("Before:")
od = OrderedDict()
od['a'] = 1
od['b'] = 2
od['c'] = 3
od['d'] = 4
for key, value in od.items():
    print(key, value)
print("\nAfter:")
od['c'] = 5
for key, value in od.items():
    print(key, value)

Output:

Before:
a 1
b 2
c 3
d 4

After:
a 1
b 2
c 5
d 4
```

> Example : OrderDictionary3.py

**Deletion and Re-Insertion** - Deleting and re-inserting the same key will push it to the back as ```OrderedDict```, however, maintains the order of insertion.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
print("Before deleting:")
od = OrderedDict()
od['a'] = 1
od['b'] = 2
od['c'] = 3
od['d'] = 4
for key, value in od.items():
    print(key, value)
print("\nAfter deleting:")
od.pop('c')
for key, value in od.items():
    print(key, value)
print("\nAfter re-inserting:")
od['c'] = 3
for key, value in od.items():
    print(key, value)

Output:

Before deleting:
a 1
b 2
c 3
d 4

After deleting:
a 1
b 2
d 4

After re-inserting:
a 1
b 2
d 4
c 3
```

> Example : OrderDictionary4.py

```python
import collections
d1 = {}
d1['a'] = 'A'
d1['b'] = 'B'
d1['c'] = 'C'
d2 = {}
d2['c'] = 'C'
d2['b'] = 'B'
d2['a'] = 'A'
print('dict:', d1 == d2)
d1 = collections.OrderedDict()
d1['a'] = 'A'
d1['b'] = 'B'
d1['c'] = 'C'
d2 = collections.OrderedDict()
d2['c'] = 'C'
d2['b'] = 'B'
d2['a'] = 'A'
print('OrderedDict:', d1 == d2)

Output:

dict: True
OrderedDict: False
```

> Example : OrderDictionary5.py

```python
import collections
d = collections.OrderedDict(
[('a', 'A'), ('b', 'B'), ('c', 'C')]
)
print('Before:')
for k, v in d.items():
    print(k, v)
d.move_to_end('b')
print('\nmove_to_end():')
for k, v in d.items():
    print(k, v)
d.move_to_end('b', last=False)
print('\nmove_to_end(last=False):')
for k, v in d.items():
    print(k, v)
```

```console
Output:

Before:
a A
b B
c C

move_to_end():
a A
c C
b B

move_to_end(last=False):
b B
a A
c C
```

The only difference between ```dict()``` and ```OrderedDict()``` is that: ```OrderedDict``` preserves the order in which the keys are inserted.

### **Exercise - 14** <a name="16.2"></a>
  1. Write a python script that contains a dictionary with name : "details" and the script should perform the steps from 1 to 7.
 ```console
 
 Consider the following Dictionary  :
  
  details = {
              "name": "Steve",
              "education": "Reed College",
              "born": 1955
            }

 1. Print all the keys and values from the dictionary separately.
 2. Add a new key "died" and assign the value "2011" to the above dictionary. And then print the updated dictionary again.
 3. Remove the "education" key from the dictionary and print the changed dictionary again.
 4. Create another duplicate dictionary with name "details_duplicate" from the above dictionary to have a backup of the existing dictionary.
 5. Remove all the elements of the "details" dictionary and then print the entire empty dictionary.
 6. Print the entire duplicate dictionary
```

## **Python Modules** <a name="17"></a>

1. Python relies heavily on modules. A Python module is a file that contains Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name plus the suffix '.py'.
2. Module definitions can be imported into other modules or the main module.
3. Example
 - Let us employ the addition module (addition.py). Enter the Python interpreter and run the following command to import this module.
 PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code>python
 ```python
 >>> import addition
 ```
 - This just adds the module name  addition to the existing symbol table, not the names of the functions added in addition. The functions can be accessed by using the module name, as illustrated below.
 ```python
 >>> addition.add(5,6)
 ```
 - If you intend to use a function frequently, you may give it a local name:
 ```python
 >>> add_func = addition.add(4,5)
 >>> add_func
 ```
4. A module have both executable statements and function definitions. These statements are used to get the module started. They are only executed the first time the module is imported. 
5. example:
```python
>>> from addition import add, add_to_n
>>> add(7, 8)
>>> add_to_n(3)
```
6. example
```python
>>> from fibonacci import *
All names except those beginning with an underscore (_) are imported.
```
7. When you import a module called addition, the interpreter looks for a file called 'addition.py' in the current directory, then in the list of directories given by the environment variable PYTHONPATH.
8. When the Python interpreter is run with the -O switch, optimised code is created and saved in.pyo files. The optimizer is currently ineffective; it simply eliminates assert statements. When -O is used, all bytecode is optimized;.pyc files are ignored, while.py files are compiled to optimised bytecode.
9. Passing two -O options to the Python interpreter (-OO) causes the bytecode compiler to execute optimizations, which may result in malfunctioning applications in rare instances. Only __doc__ strings are currently deleted from the bytecode, resulting in smaller '.pyo' files. Because certain programmes may rely on having them available, you should exercise caution while using this option.
10. A programme does not execute any quicker when read from a '.pyc' or '.pyo' file than when read from a '.py' file; the only difference is the speed with which '.pyc' or '.pyo' files are loaded.
11. It is conceivable for the same module to have a file called 'fibonacci.pyc' (or 'fibonacci.pyo' when -O is used) but no file called 'fibonacci.py'. This may be used to publish a Python code library that is relatively difficult to reverse engineer.
12. example
```python
import sys
# __debug__ is true by default, unless we run
# using -O (optimized code)
# python -O assert.py
print(__debug__)
# assert comes into affect only when __debug__ is true
num = int(input('Enter a positive number: '))
print(num)
assert(num > 0), 'Only positive numbers are allowed!'
def chkassert(num):
assert(type(num) == int)
chkassert('india')
sys.exit()
```
 <br />

## **Standard Modules** <a name="17.1"></a>

1.The Library Reference, which comes with Python, is a library of standard modules. The interpreter includes several modules that allow access to activities that are not part of the language's core but are included for efficiency or to enable access to operating system primitives such system calls.
2. example
```python
from math import *
print(fabs(-2.3))
print(factorial(5))
print(fmod(5, 2))
print(sqrt(25))
print(pow(2, 3))
print(pi)
```

## **Python Namespace** <a name="18"></a>

1. A namespace is a collection of identifiers that are stored in a container. Namespaces provide individual identifiers a sense of direction, making it feasible to distinguish between identifiers with the same exact name.
2. Namespaces in Python are specified by individual modules, and because modules can be housed in hierarchical packages, namespaces are also hierarchical.
3. When a module is imported, the names specified in the module are defined via that module's namespace and are accessed from calling modules by using the fully qualified name.
4. Examples include the collection of built-in names (functions like abs() and built-in exception names), global names in a module, and local names in a function invocation. A namespace is formed by the collection of attributes of an object.
5. Python searches the many levels of namespaces using the LEGB rule before locating the nameto-object mapping.
Local -> Enclosed -> Global -> Built-in, with arrows indicating the namespace-hierarchy search order.
- Local can be used within a function or a class method.
- Enclosed can refer to the function that is enclosing it, for example, if a function is wrapped inside another function.
- Global refers to the highest level of the executing script, and 
- Built-in are unique names reserved by Python for itself.
6. if a particular name:object mapping is not found in the local namespaces, the namespaces of
the enclosed scope is searched next. If the search in the enclosed scope is unsuccessful, too,
Python moves on to the global namespace, and eventually, it will search the built-in namespace
(if a name cannot found in any of the namespaces, a NameError is raised).
7. example
```python
lst = []
num = 10
def outer(n):
 lst.append(n)
 print(lst)
 global num
 num = 20
 print(num)
 def inner():
 num = 30
 print(num)
 return inner

func = outer(2)
func()
func = outer(3)
func()
print(num) 
```
 <br />

## **Python Packages** <a name="19"></a>

1. Packages are a method of organising Python's module namespace through the use of "dotted module names."
2. For instance, the module name C.D denotes a submodule named 'D' within a package named 'C.'
3. Just like using modules frees writers of various modules from having to worry about each other's global variable names, using dotted module names frees authors of multimodule packages from name collisions.
4. The __init__ .py is mostly used to initialise Python packages. The simplest approach to explain this is to examine the structure of a typical Python module.
```python
--+ PackageDemo
 |-- mod1.py
 |-- mod12Demo.py
 |-- mod2.py
 |-- __init__.py
```
5. The presence of the __init__ .py file in a directory signals to the Python interpreter that the directory should be handled as a Python package, as seen in the structure above. The '__init__ .py' file can simply be an empty file, but it can also execute package startup code or set the __all__ variable.
6. When using from package import item, the item can be a package submodule (or subpackage) or any other name declared in the package, such as a function, class, or variable. If the item is not declared in the package, the import statement assumes it is a module and attempts to load it. If it cannot find it, an ImportError exception is thrown.
7. If a package's __init .py' code includes a list called __all__, it is assumed to be a list of module names that should be imported when a from package import * is found. When a new version of the package is released, it is the responsibility of the package author to keep this list up to date. If package authors do not see a purpose for importing * from their package, they may choose not to support it.
8. If __all__ is not specified, the PackageDemo import * statement just guarantees that the package PackageDemo has been imported (perhaps by running its initialization code, '__init__.py') and then imports whatever names are declared in the package. Any names specified by '__init__.py' are included. It also contains any package submodules that were explicitly loaded by prior import lines.
 
9. file of mod1.py present in demo folder
 ```python
import demo.mod2
def f():
 global x
 x = 6
def getX():
 return x
def main():
 x = 5
 f()
 print(x)
 demo.mod2.g()
 x += 2
 print(x)
```
10. File of mod2.py present in demo folder

## **File Handling** <a name="20"></a>
  
### **Reading file** <a name="20.1"></a>
1. syntax for reading the file is
  open(file_name, mode)
  - The function open used to open the file and return the file object
  - mode are three types
    1. 'w' = write
    2. 'r' = read
    3. 'a' = append
2. example for file read
```
file_open = open("text.txt", "r")
print(file_open.read())
```
  
3. file read using loop
```python
file = open ("test.txt",'r')
for line in file:
  print(line, end='')
file.close()

Explaination of code
A newline character is already present in line print read from file. To prevent publishing two lines, override the default end argument after each line, newline characters.

### **Important functions and points for file handling** <a name="20.4"></a>
  
function | represents 
:----- | :----: 
readline() | Read the contents from the file until it finds newline or end of file and returns a single string
write(s) | Write the string s into the file
close()| Flush the buffer and close the file
  
1. The Python operating system module has methods for performing file-processing actions such as renaming and removing files.
2. To use this module, first import it, and then use any relevant functions.
  - The rename() function accepts two parameters: the current filename and the new filename.
  - You can delete files by passing the name of the file to be destroyed as an argument to the remove() function.
  - The os module has numerous methods for creating, removing, and changing directories.
  - To create directories in the current directory, use the os module's mkdir() function. This procedure requires an argument containing the name of the directory to be created.
  - To change the current directory, use the chdir() technique. The chdir() function accepts one argument, which is the name of the directory to be made the current directory.
 - The getcwd() function returns the path to the current working directory.
 - The rmdir() function deletes the directory that is supplied as an argument. Before eliminating a directory, it is necessary to delete all of its contents.

## **Exception Handling** <a name="21"></a> 
  1. python handles when the error/exception are occured in code by printing error message. 
  2. In try code it will check whether the code has errorsd
  3. In except code it will handles the code by printing the error message.

```python
from sys import argv
try:
    addition = float(argv[1]) + float(argv[2])
    print("The additon is", addition)
except:
    print("Error: Provide two numbers")
```
```console  
running script
PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code> python exception_handling.py suresh haresh
  
output
Error: Provide two numbers
```

 <br />
  
 ### **Exercise-16**   <a name="21.1"></a> 

 1. Write a script for multiplication of two numbers(int or float) and the input is taken from the user. When the user gives strings the error should be       handled.
```console
example two numbers are 2 5 - output is 10
example user gives are happy life - utput is "Error: Provide two numbers"
```


## **Python Build-in tools**  <a name="22"></a> 

1. These libraries aid in Python development by allowing you to walk through code, inspect stack frames, and set breakpoints, among other things.
2. The ``pdb`` module defines an interactive Python source code debugger. It allows you to establish (conditional) breakpoints and single step at the source line level, inspect stack frames, list source code, and evaluate arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame.
3. The debugger is extendable; in fact, it is specified as the class Pdb. The modules bdb and cmd are used in the extension interface.
4. The prompt from the debugger is (Pdb). ``pdb.py`` may also be used to debug other scripts as a script.

```console
 PS C:\Users\Documents\Training\code>python -m pdb addition.py
```
5. `s(tep)` - Execute the current line, stopping at the first feasible opportunity (either in a called function or on the next line in the current function).
6. `n(ext)` - Continue execution until the current function's next line is reached or it returns. (The distinction between next and step is that step stops within a called function, whereas next runs called functions at (near) full speed, pausing only at the next line in the current function.)
7. `unt(il)` - Continue execution until a line with a line number larger than the current one is reached, or until the current frame is returned.
8. `r(eturn)` - Keep running until the current function returns.
9. `c(ont(inue))` - Continue execution, stopping only when a breakpoint is reached.
`[first[, last]] l(ist]` - Display the source code for the currently selected file. List 11 lines surrounding the current line or continue the previous listing without arguments. List 11 lines that are centred on one argument. List the specified range using two parameters; if the second argument is smaller than the first, it is understood as a count.
11. `a(rgs)` - Print the current function's argument list.
12. `p(rint)` expression - Evaluate the expression and print its value in the current context.
13. `execute [args...]` - Run the debugged Python programme again (with without an argument). Breakpoints, actions, and debugger choices are all saved. "restart" is an abbreviation for "run."
14. `q(uit)` - Exit the debugger. The currently running programme is terminated.
15. The distutils package allows you to generate and install new modules into your Python system. The new modules may be entirely Python, extension modules written in C, or collections of Python packages including modules written in both Python and C.

16. As a programmer, we should do is
 - generate a source distribution 
 - write a setup script (setup.py by standard) 
 - (optionally) write a setup configuration file
 - Create one or more built (binary) distributions (optional).

### **List Comprehension** <a name="23"></a> 

1. List comprehensions are a modern approach to construct **new lists**.
2. Syntax of list comprehension
> list_syntax = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
3. Note: An if condition may or may not be present in list comprehension. Multiple fors can be found in a list comprehension (nested list comprehensions).
4. Example - 1 (Iterating through a string Using List Comprehension)

```python
# using loop

separate_to_letters = []

for letter in 'Multiple Wishes':
    separate_to_letters.append(letter)

print(separate_to_letters)
```
```console
#output
['M', 'u', 'l', 't', 'i', 'p', 'l', 'e', ' ', 'W', 'i', 's', 'h', 'e', 's']
```


```python
#using list comprehension

separate_to_letters = [ letter for letter in 'Multiple Wishes' ]
print(separate_to_letters)
```
```console
#output

['M', 'u', 'l', 't', 'i', 'p', 'l', 'e', ' ', 'W', 'i', 's', 'h', 'e', 's']
```

5.  Example - 2 (Conditionals in List Comprehension)
```python
number_list = [ x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(number_list)
```
```console
#output

[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

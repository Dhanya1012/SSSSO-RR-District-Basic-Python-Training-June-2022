# # Zen of Python:A Pythoneer once wrote 20 aphorisms stating how one can write beautiful and clean code with Python. 
# Came to be known as “The Zen of Python”, these aphorisms exploded amongst Python developers.
# Tim Peters wrote these BDFL’s (Benevolent Dictator For Life, a nickname of Python creator Guido van Rossum) 20 guiding principles for Python’s design but the last aphorism was left for van Rossum to fill in.
#Till today, there are 19 aphorisms as Rossum said that the last aphorism is “some bizarre Tim Peters in-joke.”
